## 🔧 Workflow

### Recommended Processing Order:

1. **Prepare Raw Data**: Place AirSim data in the `RawData/` folder. You can also use the sample configuration from the `Airsim settings/` folder
2. **Check Settings**: Verify parameters in `Settings.txt` (camera parameters, paths, etc.)
3. **Run Data Generator**: Process raw data and generate depth/disparity maps
4. **Annotate Images**: Use manual or automatic mode to label objects
5. **Verify Results**: Use viewers to confirm annotation quality
6. **Generate Output**: Export labels and create demo animations

## ⚙️ Configuration

### AirSim Configuration

The `Airsim settings/settings.json` file contains sample AirSim configuration:
- Camera sensor settings
- Stereo camera setup
- Image capture settings
- Use this as a reference when configuring your AirSim environment

### Processing Configuration

The main configuration file `Tools&Settings/Settings.txt` contains:
- Camera parameters (focal length, baseline, image dimensions)
- Input/output paths
- Processing settings
- Color thresholds for automatic annotation

Edit settings using:
- Built-in Settings Editor (accessible from Control Panel)
- Manual editing of `Settings.txt`

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- **Depth Map Issues**: Check MaxDepth setting if depth maps display abnormally
- **Poor Annotation**: Adjust color threshold parameters in settings
- **Batch Processing**: Test with a small range before processing large datasets
- **Backup**: Regularly backup important annotation results
- **Performance**: Close unused viewer windows to improve performance

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (Currently Windows only)
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: Depends on dataset size (allow several GB for processed data)
- **Display**: 1920x1080 minimum resolution recommended

> **Note**: This toolkit is currently optimized for Windows operating systems. Linux and macOS support may be added in future releases.

## 🌐 Language Support

The toolkit supports both Chinese and English interfaces. Click the "🌐 Language" button in the Control Panel to switch between languages. All tools will launch with the selected language.

## 📝 Output Formats

### YOLO Format
```
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>
```
All values are normalized (0.0 to 1.0)

### MOT Format
```
<frame_id>,<track_id>,<x>,<y>,<width>,<height>,<confidence>,<class_id>,<visibility>,<x_3d>,<y_3d>,<z_3d>
```
Includes 3D coordinates from depth information

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **File Not Found**: Check that paths in `Settings.txt` are correct
- **GUI Not Displaying**: Verify PyQt5 installation: `pip install PyQt5`
- **Depth Map Errors**: Ensure .pfm files are valid and not corrupted
- **No Data to Process**: Verify that AirSim simulation has been run and data has been collected
- **AirSim Configuration Issues**: Refer to the [AirSim documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/) for setup help
